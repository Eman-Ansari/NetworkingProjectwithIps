This diagram depicts the network topology of a school in Karachi, Pakistan. The network consists of several interconnected devices, including:

1. PCs (Personal Computers)
2. Servers
3. Routers
4. Switches
The devices are connected using a variety of cables, including:

Ethernet cables
Serial cables
The network is divided into several subnets, each with its own IP address range. This helps to segment the network and improve traffic flow.

# Devices

PCs: These are the workstations used by students and staff. They are typically connected to the network via Ethernet cables.
Servers: These are computers that store data and provide services to other devices on the network. In this diagram, there are two servers:
Server-PT (DNS Server)
Server-PT (Web Server)

# Routers: 
These devices connect different networks together. They route data packets from one network to another. In this diagram, there are five routers:
Router0, Router1,, Router2, Router3, Router5 (Nazimabad Branch), Router6 (Malir Branch)

# Switches: 
These devices connect multiple devices to a single network segment. They forward data packets to the appropriate device on the network. In this diagram, there are five switches:
Switch0, Switch1, Switch2, Switch4, Switch5, Subnets

# The network is divided into the following subnets:

10.0.0.0/29
100.10.10.0/30
100.10.10.20/30
100.10.10.4/30
Each subnet has a different IP address range. This helps to segment the network and improve traffic flow. For example, the devices in the 10.0.0.0/29 subnet can communicate with each other, but they cannot communicate with devices in the 100.10.10.0/30 subnet without going through a router.

# Conclusion

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the network topology of a school in Karachi, Pakistan. The network consists of a variety of devices that are interconnected to provide network services to students and staff. The network is segmented into subnets to improve traffic flow.
